Oxygen Webos
============

This is here simply for posterity and free hosting.

Oxygen Webos is an interface for a web operating system, like the HTML/CSS/JavaScript part of ChromeOS. It was my final year project in high school, and was inspired by things like [eyeOS](http://www.eyeos.com/).

The visual design is pretty much a clone of KDE 4.0.

Depends on some old versions of jQuery and jQuery UI.

Features
--------

* Window management
* Task manager
* Application launcher
* Desktop icons
* Basic sample applications
* Modular project architecture

Some of the file management features don't work, because they require PHP. Run on it on a server with PHP and everything should be ok.
